# TopoToImage Installation Guide

## üì¶ Installing on macOS

### Important Security Notice

**Why am I seeing a security warning?**

TopoToImage is not code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate ($99/year). This means macOS Gatekeeper will block the application on first launch. This is a normal security feature - the application is safe to use.

### Installation Steps

1. **Download** `TopoToImage-v4.0.0-beta.1-macOS.dmg` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/jlert/TopoToImage/releases)

2. **Open the DMG** by double-clicking it

3. **Drag TopoToImage.app** to your Applications folder (or anywhere you prefer)

4. **First Launch - Bypass Gatekeeper:**

   **Method 1: Right-Click (Recommended)**
   - Right-click (or Control-click) on TopoToImage.app
   - Select "Open" from the menu
   - Click "Open" in the security dialog
   - You only need to do this once - future launches work normally

   **Method 2: System Settings**
   - Try to open TopoToImage.app by double-clicking
   - When the security warning appears, click "Open System Settings"
   - Navigate to **Privacy & Security**
   - Scroll down to the **Security** section
   - Click **"Open Anyway"** next to the TopoToImage message
   - Enter your administrator password if prompted
   - Try launching TopoToImage again

5. **Subsequent Launches:** After the first successful launch, you can open TopoToImage normally by double-clicking

### Troubleshooting

**"TopoToImage is damaged and can't be opened"**

If you see this message, macOS has quarantined the app. Open Terminal and run:
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/TopoToImage.app
```
Then try Method 1 above.

## üêç Running from Source

If you prefer to run TopoToImage from source code (or are on Windows/Linux):

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### macOS / Linux Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jlert/TopoToImage.git
   cd TopoToImage
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python3 topotoimage.py
   ```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Windows Installation - Important Notice

**TopoToImage has not been tested on Windows.** The developer does not have a Windows system and cannot provide Windows-specific support.

**The main challenge:** The GDAL dependency (required by the rasterio library) is notoriously difficult to install on Windows. It requires C++ compilation tools that are complex to set up.

**For experienced Windows Python developers willing to experiment:**

The following installation approaches were suggested by Claude Code (an AI coding assistant) but have not been verified by the developer:

**Option 1: Use pipwin for pre-built wheels**
```
py -m pip install pipwin
py -m pipwin install gdal
py -m pipwin install rasterio
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Option 2: Use Conda (often more reliable on Windows)**
```
conda create -n topotoimage python=3.10
conda activate topotoimage
conda install -c conda-forge gdal rasterio
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Known limitation:** The "Reveal in Finder" menu option will not work on Windows (macOS-specific feature).

**üôè We need Windows contributors!** If you successfully install and run TopoToImage on Windows, please document your process and share it via GitHub Issues or Discussions. Your contribution would help many future users!

### System Requirements
- **macOS:** 10.13 (High Sierra) or later - ‚úÖ Fully tested
- **Windows:** Windows 10 or later - ‚ö†Ô∏è Not tested, GDAL installation challenging
- **Linux:** Most modern distributions with Python 3.8+ - ‚ö†Ô∏è Not tested
