# Contributing to TopoToImage 4.0

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TopoToImage! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this recreation of the classic 1990s terrain visualization software.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jlert/TopoToImage.git
   cd TopoToImage
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Test the installation**
   ```bash
   python src/main_window_qt_designer.py
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise

### Testing
- Test your changes with the sample data in `assets/sample_data/`
- Verify cross-platform compatibility when possible
- Ensure UI changes work with Qt Designer files

### File Organization
- **Core logic**: Place in `src/` directory
- **UI files**: Qt Designer files go in `ui/` directory  
- **Assets**: Icons, maps, samples go in `assets/` directory
- **Documentation**: User-facing docs in `docs/` directory

## üéØ Areas for Contribution

- **Windows/Linux Support** - The application is built with cross-platform libraries (PyQt6) but has only been tested on macOS. We need contributors to test and create installers for Windows and Linux. If you successfully run TopoToImage on Windows or Linux, please document the process and contribute installation instructions!
- **Performance optimization** - Improve rendering speed for large datasets
- **Rendering improvements** - Antialias map images
- **Documentation improvements** - User guides and tutorials
